  Abstract                 = {Utilizing the microdata from a first cross-section of a new household survey at the University of Hamburg, we analyse if consumers respond to their own inflation expectations and economic news that they have observed recently when they plan to adjust their savings portfolio in the next year. We extract three factors to control for consumers' socio-demographic and personality characteristics. Our estimates from the socio-demographic factors suggest that high education and personal income matter most for a planned savings portfolio adjustment. Interestingly, higher inflation expectations only affect planned savings adjustments due to higher interest rates, suggesting that consumers have a Taylor-rule-type relation in mind. Disentangling the effects of economic news, we find that news on higher inflation lead consumers to consider protection against inflation, safety of the portfolio and higher interest rates as reasons for a savings adjustment. In addition positive news on the business cycle and on the Euro crisis increase the likelihood that consumers consider a savings adjustment to protect against inflation or due to higher expected interest rates, respectively. Overall, it seems that economic news observed are incorporated into decisions regarding a planned savings portfolio adjustment, while inflation expectations play an indirect role.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze cross-household inflation dispersion in Europe using fictitious monthly inflation rates for several household categories (grouped according to income levels, household size, socio-economic status, age) for the period from 1997 to 2008. Our analysis is carried out on a panel of 23 up to 27 household-specific inflation rates per country for 15 countries. In the first part of the paper, we employ time series and related non-stationary panel approaches to shed light on cross-country differences in inflation inequality with respect to the number of driving forces in the panel. In particular, we focus on the degree of persistence of the household-specific inflation rates and their the adjustment behaviour towards the inflation rate of a representative household. In the second part of the paper, we pool over the full sample of all countries and test if and by how much certain household categories across Europe are more prone to significant inflation differentials and significant differences in the volatility of inflation. Furthermore we search for the presence of clusters with respect to inflation susceptibility. On the national level, we find evidence for the existence of one main driving factor driving the non-stationarity of the panel and evidence for a single co-integration vector. Persistence of deviations, however, is high, and the adjustment speed towards the representative household is low. Even if there is no concern about a long-run stable distribution, at least in the short- to medium run deviations tend to last. On the European level, we find small but significant differences (mainly along income levels), we can separate 5 clusters and two main driving forces for the differences in the overall panel. All in all, even if differences are relatively small, they are not negligible and persistent enough to represent a serious matter of debate for economic and social policy.},

Our findings show that, in general, the forecasters did not share a common belief about the shocks driving the economy at the time at which they made their forecasts. We use a standard textbook aggregate-demand/aggregate-supply curve to identify the nature of the shocks expected by the forecasters. This exercise reveals that the forecasters have very divergent expectations regarding the nature of the shocks predicted to hit the economy in the coming year.

We then use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to study the accuracy of forecasts. Results show that the short-term interest rate and the term spread are important leading indicators, but also that the stock market has some predictive value. The recession probability is a nonlinear function of these leading indicators. The BRT approach also helps to recover how the recession probability depends on the interactions of the leading indicators. While the predictive power of the short-term interest rates has declined over time, the term spread and the stock market have gained in importance. We also study how the shape of a forecasters utility function affects the optimal choice of a cutoff value above which the estimated recession prob- ability should be interpreted as a signal of a recession. The BRT approach shows a competitive out-of-sample performance compared to popular Pro- bit approaches.},

(2005). Furthermore, we test for the rationality of the forecasts under the assumption of a possibly asymmetric loss function and for the features of an optimal forecast under the assumption of a generalised loss function. We find evidence of the existence of an asymmetric loss function of German forecasters only in the case of pooled data and a quad-quad loss function. We can reject the hypothesis of rationality of the growth forecasts based on a pooled dataset, but not on data for single institutions.

We find that the upwards bias of reported perceptions and expectations is higher under the price wording and responses are more heterogeneous, but non-response rates are higher in the infl ation wording. Generally, consumers have lower perceptions or expectations with a higher level of education, which also significantly lowers the probability of non-response. Consumers that perceived positive news on monetary policy or infl ation also tend to give lower infl ation estimates and vice versa. Additionally, our results suggest that happier individuals have significantly lower perceptions and expectations under the price wording, while more risk-averse consumers give significantly higher in flation estimates under the inflation wording.},

Specifically, under the assumption of loss aversion, inflation changes above a certain reference rate will be perceived more strongly. Rejecting rationality of inflation perceptions in general under symmetric loss and in a majority of cases under flexible loss functions, panel smooth transition models give evidence of nonlinearities in the inflation-perceptions relation regarding both actual inflation and time. This result is confirmed by dynamic fixed effects estimates, where the slope of the estimated value function is significantly steeper in the loss region and the implied average reference inflation rate is found close to 2\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Building on Prospect Theory, we apply the concept of loss aversion to the formation of inflation perceptions and test empirically for non- linearities in the inflation-perceptions relation for a panel of 10 Euro area countries. Specifically, under the assumption of loss aversion, inflation changes above a certain reference rate will be perceived more strongly. Rejecting rationality of inflation perceptions in general under symmetric loss and in a majority of cases under flexible loss functions, panel smooth transition models give evidence of non-linearities in the inflation perception formation regarding both actual inflation and time. This result is confirmed by dynamic fixed effects estimates, where the slope of the estimated value function is significantly steeper in the loss region and the implied average reference inflation rate is found close to 2\%.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we investigate if the actual debate on divergences in the Euro area is indeed a reason to be concerned. We argue that the standard definition of divergence in terms of standard deviations is too narrow to capture the persistence in deviations in output, prices and wages. Our analysis reveals that deviations are indeed persistent in the Euro area. To investigate a control group, we present results for unit labour cost dynamics in (West) Germany's Länder and the United States' federal states. The results show that the recent development in the Euro area is indeed special and potentially harmful. Dieser Aufsatz untersucht, inwieweit die jüngste Debatte um mögliche Divergenzen in der Eurozone tatsächlich einen Grund zur Besorgnis aufzählt. Dabei wird argumentiert, dass die häufig übliche Definition von Divergenzen als die Veränderung der Standardabweichung bei Inflation und Wirtschaftswachstum um den Euro-Mittelwert zu kurz greift, da diese Definition nicht die Persistenz in der Entwicklung aufzeigt und damit gefährliche Verschiebungen im Niveau von Wirtschaftsleistung und relativem Preis- und Lohnniveau nicht erfasst. Eine dementsprechende Analyse zeigt, dass die Divergenzen in der Eurozone tatsächlich sehr hartnäckig sind. In einem Vergleich mit der Entwicklung von Lohnstückkosten mit jenen zwischen US-Staaten und deutschen Bundesländern zeigt sich zudem, dass die aktuellen Entwicklungen in der Eurozone tatsächlich für eine Währungsunion ungewöhnlich und potenziell wirtschaftlich schädlich sind.},

Eine Untersuchung der Lohnstückkostenentwicklung in den einzelnen Euro-Ländern und ein Vergleich der nationalen Differenzierungen im Euroraum mit regionalen Entwicklungen in den beiden \&quot;Währungsräumen\&quot; USA und Westdeutschland zeigt, dass der Euroraum tatsächlich eine Reihe von Besonderheiten aufweist: Während sich die Entwicklung in einem Großteil des Euroraums durchaus im Rahmen dessen hält, was in anderen Währungsräumen zu beobachten ist, haben einige Länder seit Beginn der Währungsunion ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit stark verändert. So hat sich die Position der südeuropäischen Länder um rund ein Zehntel verschlechtert, während sich diejenige Deutschlands in fast dem gleichen Ausmaß verbessert hat. Auch zeigen die Untersuchungen, dass der Lohnstückkostenanstieg in einzelnen Ländern immer noch strukturell deutlich vom Durchschnitt abweicht; dies deutet auf eine dauerhafte Divergenz hin. Schließlich scheinen länderspezifische Faktoren im Euroraum bei der Lohnkostenentwicklung eine sehr große Rolle zu spielen; Abweichungen vom gemeinsamen Trend wirken zudem länger nach als entsprechende regionale Divergenzen in den USA oder in Westdeutschland. Das dauerhafte Auseinanderlaufen nationaler Lohnstückkostenentwicklungen im Euroraum kann längerfristig zu Wachstumseinbußen führen, und es birgt Risiken bezüglich des Fortbestehens der Währungsunion.},

  abstract = {The long-term development in productivity in an economy is the main indicator in an assessment of the outlook for economic development. In theory, countries that lag behind the leading countries in productivity should gradually succeed in closing that gap. Since the mid-1990s the Federal Republic of Germany has not been able to continue the process of catching up with the trend in productivity in the United States that was typical until then. In past decades the development in Germany compared with the United States was dominated by the process of introducing best-practice technologies, for example modern information and communications technologies, but that has evidently faltered now. That is still the conclusion to be drawn after the introduction of the new methods of calculating the national accounts, which were expected to reduce the methodological differences in the assessment of productivity between Germany and the United States. However, the gap in productivity growth between the two economies may be expected to shrink again in the medium term, partly because the structural reforms on the labour market and the investment in modern information and communications technologies made in the past should have a positive effect. Productivity growth matters in the long run. As only the wealth created can be distributed the speed at which the efficiency of an economy is increasing will mark the limit for this distribution. So without a clear rise in efficiency the population in a country cannot expect their material prosperity to continue to rise. Owing to this fundamental interrelation determining the medium to long-term growth rate in productivity, and here especially the productivity of labour, is of crucial importance. Since the mid-1990s the typical process of catching up with the development in productivity in the United States has been interrupted in Germany. Until now economists have always assumed that a country with a lower level of productivity will be able},

Haben sich Konjunkturprognosen bewährt? Was sind die Gründe für Unterschiede bei der Prognosegüte? Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass die untersuchten Prognosen im Großen und Ganzen den Kriterien der Unverzerrtheit und Rationalität genügen. Bezüglich Beschleunigungen und Verlangsamungen schneiden sie auf jeden Fall deutlich besser als ein Münzwurf ab. Allerdings sind die Fehlermargen relativ hoch und nehmen mit der Länge des Prognosezeitraums zu - Konjunkturprognosen sind unsicher.

Prognoseinstitutionen sollten zudem ihre Prognoseinstrumente wissenschaftlich nachvollziehbar machen und die Anwendungsbedingungen ihrer Aussagen offen legen.},

Gemessen an Produktion, Investitionen und Konsumausgaben verlief die Rezession ausgesprochen mild. Inzwischen ist es zu einer deutlichen Erholung gekommen. Dies liegt vor allem an der starken antizyklischen Reaktion der Wirtschaftspolitik. Allerdings geht die Restrukturierung der Unternehmen bisher nur mit einer geringen Beschäftigungserholung einher. Zwei Ungleichgewichte werden die weitere Erholung in den USA belasten: das Leistungsbilanzdefizit und das öffentliche Defizit},

Um die Fähigkeit, Rezessionen zu prognostizieren, zu testen, wird der von Estrella/Mishkin vorgeschlagene Ansatz benutzt. Für die Einteilung der Konjunkturphasen wurde auf Artis et. al. (1997) zurückgegriffen. Der Einwand von Dueker (1997), dass es wichtig ist, zu kontrollieren, ob die Wirtschaft sich schon in einer Rezession befindet, wurde berücksichtigt. Die Resultate der Schätzung sind insgesamt unbefriedigend. Nur die Ifo-Geschäftserwartungen von Vorleistungsgüterproduzenten, die Zinsdifferenz, die langfristigen Zinsen sowie die Geldmenge M2 zeigen befriedigende Vorlaufeigenschaften. In this paper we used a data set constructed for a companion paper (Fritsche/Stephan, 2000) where we explored the leading indicator properties of different time series for the German business cycle. Now we test for the ability of different indicator series to forecast recessions by using a probit approach as proposed by Estrella/Mishkin (1997). The dating procedure refers to the study by Artis et. al. (1997). We took into consideration the criticism made by Dueker (1997) who stated that in the probit model the fact that the economy is already in a state of recession must be controlled for. The results of our estimate are unsatisfactory on the whole. Only the ifo institute's business expectation of producers of intermediate inputs, the interest rate spread, the long-term interest rate, and money supply M2 show satisfactory leading properties.},

Die Finanzpolitik stimuliert noch in diesem Jahr den privaten Verbrauch, die Geldpolitik ist auf einen kräftigen expansiven Kurs umgeschwenkt. Die Gefahr einer Inflationsbeschleunigung besteht nicht.

Vor Beginn der europäischen Währungsunion (EWU) ging es um die Frage, ob nicht nur die konjunkturelle Entwicklung in Europa synchron verlaufen würde, sondern auch auf welchem Niveau sich eine Angleichung der Realzinsen vollziehen würde. Befürchtungen, dass die Realzinsen im EWU-Durchschnitt steigen würde, wurden entkräftet. Stattdessen näherten sie sich dem vergleichsweise niedrigen deutschen Niveau an. Wegen der Stabilitätsfortschritte bedeutet dies für die meisten Länder eine Senkung der nominalen Verzinsung. Dies ermöglichte einigen Ländern wie Spanien oder Irland schon im Vorfeld der Währungsunion beeindruckende Wachstumsraten. Auch Länder wie Deutschland, in denen die direkten Effekte der Zinskonvergenz gering waren, profitieren von der steigenden Nachfrage insbesondere nach Investitionsgütern. Allerdings kam durch die weltweiten Turbulenzen im Gefolge der Asienkrise auch in Europa in den Jahren 1998 und 1999 zu einer Abschwächung der konjunkturellen Dynamik. Gestützt auf einen unerwartet schwachen Euro/Dollar-Wechselkurs sowie die Konjunkturerholung in den krisengeschüttelten Ländern belebte sich im Jahresverlauf 1999 auch die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in den Ländern des EWU-Raumes wieder.},

  Abstract                 = {Ifo business climate and other Ifo indicators will be investigated to assess its properties. Properties of Ifo indicators either following the old institutional classification or the newer possibility of use classification will be checked against long-term time series according the new statistical classification (NACE or WZ 93). The business cycle component is detrended using an Hodrick Prescott filter. The series are tested for structural stability. The results show structural breaks, but, after the break, the stability of leading properties became stronger. Long-term indicators have no worse stability properties than short-term indicators - that means their use for forecasting is possible. Ifo-Indikatoren werden auf ihre Vorlaufeigenschaften, auf Granger-Kausalität, die Stabilität der Vorlaufbeziehung und einen Strukturbruch untersucht. Da die Ifo-Reihen noch nicht auf die neue Gliederung der amtlichen Statistik (WZ 93) umgestellt wurden, wird erstmals die Eignung der verschiedenen Indikatoren nach institutioneller und Verwendungszweckgliederung gemessen an den umbasierten Produktionsindexreihen nach WZ 93 beurteilt. Ebenfalls neu ist, daß zur Beurteilung der Konjunkturkomponente eine normierte Trendabweichung von einem Hodrick-Prescott-Filter benutzt wurde. Die These der Strukturkonstanz ist zurückzuweisen; die Stabilität der Vorlaufbeziehung in den 90er Jahren ist enger geworden. Die Indikatoren mit längerem Vorlauf (Geschäftserwartungen und Produktionspläne) weisen keine nachweisbar geringere Stabilität auf.},

  Abstract                 = {Konjunkturprognostiker und deren prognostische Fähigkeiten standen schon oft im Kreuzfeuer der öffentlichen Kritik. Seit einiger Zeit mehren sich die Fragen über die Tauglichkeit von Konjunkturprognosen. Da war vom \&quot;Blindflug der Forscher\&quot; zu lesen (vgl. Der Spiegel 2005), Feuilletonisten forderten \&quot;Entlasst die Experten\&quot; (vgl. FAZ 2005a) und auch Altbundeskanzler Gerhard Schröder hegte wenig Sympathie für \&quot;diese Art der Wissenschaft, die ihn an Meteorologie erinnere\&quot; (vgl. FAZ 2005b). Dass viele Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute mit öffentlichen Geldern gefördert werden, steigert den Legitimationsdruck zusätzlich. Umso wichtiger ist es, die Debatte zu versachlichen und sich Grenzen, Möglichkeiten und Chancen der Konjunkturprognosen unter Verwendung nachprüfbarer Kriterien vor Augen zu führen.1 Der folgende Beitrag soll dazu beitragen. Dazu wird zunächst im Abschnitt 2 der Frage nachgegangen, welche erkenntnistheoretischen Probleme es grundsätzlich bei Prognosen gibt und was diese leisten können. Abschnitt 3 beschreibt den für die folgenden empirischen Untersuchungen verwendeten Datensatz. Im Abschnitt 4 geht es um die Treffgenauigkeit und Rationalität von Prognosen und im Abschnitt 5 soll geklärt werden, warum Prognosen differieren und welche Bestimmungsgründe es für Phasen hoher Divergenz bei den Prognosen geben könnte. Abschnitt 6 fasst die Ergebnisse zusammen.},

  Abstract                 = {New-Keynesian macroeconomic models typically assume that any long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment is ruled out. While this appears to be a reasonable characterization of the US economy, it is less clear that the natural rate hypothesis necessarily holds in a European country like Germany where hysteretic effects may invalidate it. Inspired by the framework developed by Farmer (2000) and Beyer and Farmer (2002), we investigate the long-run relationships between the interest rate, unemployment and inflation in West Germany from the early 1960s up to 2004 using a multivariate co-integration analysis technique. The results point to a structural break in the late 1970s. In the later time period we find for west Germany data a strong negative correlation between the trend components of inflation and unemployment. We show that this finding contradicts the natural rate hypothesis, introduce a version of the New Keynesian model which allows for some hysteresis and compare the effectiveness of monetary policy in these two models. In general, a policy rule with an aggressive response to a rise in unemployment performs better in a model with hysteretic characteristics than in a model without.},

Acknowledging that the Taylor rule as a substitute for the LM-curve has its merits we show that standard DSGE models do not model how the central bank achieves its targets. In filling this gap we make evident that models neglecting a store-of-value function of money but still assuming a Taylor rule are inconsistent. Our major point concerns the-so called new Keynesian IS-curve. We prove that DSGE models which typically rest on the assumption of representative agents are unable to derive the IS-curve. This implies that these models lack the capability to analyse the role of savings as a a gap in aggregate demand. By assuming overlapping generations we make evident how this shortcoming can be avoided. We also show how OLG models add a richer dynamics to the standard DSGE approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The Gemeinschaftsdiagnose [Joint Diagnosis (JD)] is the most influential semi-annual mac-roeconomic forecast in Germany. Jointly produced by up to six institutes, its accuracy as well as the large number of involved participants is often criticised. This study examines the JDs growth and inflation forecasts from 1970 to 2007, including most of the contributions of the forecasts submitted by the five institutes at the start of the JD. Four questions are addressed: (i) Are these forecasts unbiased and efficient? (ii) How do results change if we presume an asymmetric loss function? (iii) Are any of the institutes more accurate than the JD? Are five/six institutes necessary and at what cost? (iv) Do the institutes make strategic forecasts to influence the JD forecast? Results show that there is no strong evidence of bias or inefficiency of the institutes forecasts and no evidence of asymmetric loss functions. Five institutes are not necessary, but it is very hard to predict the redundant institutes; however, the loss of accu-racy by employing only two is small.},

Vor dem Hintergrund guter Konjunkturaussichten und einer anhaltend schwachen Notierung des Euro an den Devisenmärkten hat sie mit der jüngsten Erhöhung der Leitzinsen Ende April ihren im Herbst vergangenen Jahres eingeschlagenen restriktiveren Kurs fortgesetzt. Zwar sind von der Anhebung um 0,25 Prozentpunkte für sich genommen keine gravierenden Auswirkungen zu erwarten, doch ist der Leitzins nunmehr bereits um 1 ¼ Prozentpunkte höher als vor einem halben Jahr. Von der Geldpolitik dürften damit kaum noch belebende Impulse auf die Konjunktur ausgehen. Vielmehr ist zu erwarten, dass weitere, die Konjunktur dämpfende Zinserhöhungen folgen werden. Die Begründung der EZB, dass vor allem von der Euro-Schwäche, aber auch von der guten Konjunktur Inflationsgefahren ausgehen, überzeugt insgesamt nicht. Aus binnenwirtschaftlichen Gründen ist die Preisstabilität in Europa derzeit nicht gefährdet. Lediglich eine weitere deutliche Abwertung des Euro kann Inflationsrisiken mit sich bringen. Dies wäre für sich ein Grund für die EZB, die Zinsen zu erhöhen, um den Kurs des Euro zu stützen. Gerade im Hinblick auf die Wechselkursstabilisierung handelt die EZB jedoch kontraproduktiv. Die Zinserhöhungen behindern die volle Entfaltung des Konjunkturaufschwungs in Westeuropa und damit die Überwindung dessen, was die Schwäche des Euro gegenüber dem US-Dollar ausmachen dürfte: die im Verhältnis zu den USA ungünstigeren Konjunkturerwartungen in Westeuropa.},

This approach is extremely flexible on order to model a large number of transition paths to convergence. We find regional clusters in consumer price level data. GDP deflator data and unit labor cost data are far less clustered than CPI data.

A lower level of variance in an autoregressive model of output growth can be either due to a change in the structure of the economy (a change in the propagation mechanism) or a reduced error term variance (reduced impulses). In Germany the decline output volatility is due to a decline in the persistence of the growth process. This is in contrast to the US results, where a break in the variance seems to dominate the decline in persistence. A change in the conduct of monetary policy (the establishment of another monetary policy regime) could be part of an explanation for the change in propagation. Stochastic simulations with a New Keynesian DSGE model support the hypothesis.},

Special attention is given to possible changes in the convergence process during the euro cash changeover. We apply the sigma-convergence approach using both panel estimates of changes in the deterministic time trend of a coefficient of variation and stochastic kernel-density estimates. We find that convergence took place before 2000, slowed down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfaced after 2003. This points to a non-linear convergence path. We show that stronger convergence is associated with periods of positive and less-dispersed output gaps across member states. There are no big differences between the results for tradables and non-tradables, indicating that Balassa-Samuelson effects are relatively weak.},

Confirming findings documented by Farmer (2015) for U.S. data, we found that the stock market Granger causes unemployment in the short run and the long run when we control for a deterministic trend in the unemployment rate. Results of a frequency-domain test show that, in the short run, feedback cannot be rejected, whereas the causality clearly runs from the stock market to the unemployment rate in the medium to long run.},

We suggest that revisions of data is an important source of uncertainty about the state of the economy. This paper evaluates the quality of major real macroeconomic Euro area variables, published by Eurostat since 2001. The real time data set contains 159 vintages, covering the period of January 1991 until March 2014. The information content or informativeness of revision is measured using three methods: descriptive error statistics, signal-to-noise ratios and entropy measures. Our results document a trend of growing data uncertainty over the past decade for Euro area variables. As a robustness check, we reckon our results using US data and additionally show that uncertainty calculations are robust towards changes in final revision definition. Moreover, Euro area signal-noise-ratios and entropy measures are correlated with popular uncertainty proxies, Euro area news-based EPU and the VSTOXX. Our finding corresponds to the recent literature on increased macroeconomic uncertainty and especially economic policy uncertainty during and after the Great Recession.},

  Abstract                 = {New-Keynesian macroeconomic models typically assume that any long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment is ruled out. While this appears to be a reasonable characterization of the US economy, it is less clear that the natural rate hypothesis necessarily holds in a European country like Germany where hysteretic effects may invalidate it. Inspired by the framework developed by Farmer (2000) and Beyer and Farmer (2002), we investigate the long-run relationships between the interest rate, unemployment and inflation in West Germany from the early 1960s up to 2004 using a multivariate co-integration analysis technique. The results point to a structural break in the late 1970s. In the later time period we find for West German data a strong negative correlation between the trend components of inflation and unemployment. We show that this finding contradicts the natural rate hypothesis, introduce a version of the New Keynesian model which allows for some hysteresis and compare the effectiveness of monetary policy in these two models. In general, a policy rule with an aggressive response to a rise in unemployment performs better in a model with hysteretic characteristics than in a model without.},

Zwar war es gelungen, die dramatischen Inflationstendenzen zu Beginn der 90er Jahre zu durchbrechen. Die Wirtschaftspolitik hatte aber keinen Spielraum, die hiermit verbundene deflationäre Entwicklung zu verhindern. Als der US-Dollar Mitte der 90er Jahre deutlich aufwertete, führte dies dazu, dass sich die Deflationstendenz verfestigte, und Argentinien geriet - bei stetig steigender Auslandsverschuldung - in eine bis zuletzt anhaltende Depression.

Für den europäischen Integrationsprozess wurden bereits im Vorfeld Vorkehrungen getroffen, die sicher stellen sollten, dass eine Währungsunion erfolgreich im Sinne von mehr Wachstum und Beschäftigung sein konnte.

The survey provides expected data from professional forecaster up to 6 quarters ahead for a range of major industrial countries. This makes it ideal for extracting the structural parameters of the sticky information Phillips curve.

As opposed to the benchmark rational expectation models, households in the sticky information environment update their expectations sporadically rather than instantaneously owing to the costs of acquiring and processing information. We estimate two alternative parametrizations of the sticky information model which differ in the stationarity assumptions about the underlying series. Using survey data on households? and experts? inflation expectations, we find that the model adequately captures the dynamics of household inflation expectations. Both parametrizations imply comparable speeds of information updating for the European households as was previously found in the US, on average roughly once a year.},

The study also investigates the impact of price developments at the euro changeover on different households by socio-economic group. The third part of the report focuses on inflation perceptions and a fourth section explores the cross-border convergence of prices since the euro changeover. The following findings can be highlighted: (1) it appears that aggregate inflation rates were largely unaffected by the introduction of the euro; (2) overall, differences in inflation rates across different types of households are small; (3) inflation perceptions are mainly driven by lagged perceptions, inflation expectations and actual inflation while different individual inflation experiences also help to explain the 'jumps' in perception data; (4) price differentials have generally declined over time across European countries though there is no sizeable euro introduction convergence effect.},

We test the hypotheses of Prospect Theory with regard to households inflation perceptions underlying Brachingers IPI in a panel estimation for 12 European countries. There is evidence that perceptions react more strongly to losses in inflation than to gains before the Euro cash changeover, but not afterwards. Moreover, we find empirical support for the availability hypothesis, stating that frequently bought goods have a stronger influence on inflation perceptions than the overall price index.},

Using data for 82 respondents from 37 different institutions, we investigate what models and theories forecasters subscribe to and find that they are pronounced conservative in the sense, that they overwhelmingly rely on methods and theories that have been well-established for a long time, while more recent approaches are relatively unimportant for the practice of business cycle forecasting. DSGE models are mostly used in public institutions. In line with findings in the literature there are tendencies of ''leaning towards consensus'' (especially for public institutions) and ''sticky adjustment of forecasts'' with regard to new information. We find little evidence that the behaviour of forecasters has changed fundamentally since the Great Recession but there are signs that forecast errors are evaluated more carefully. Also, a stable relationship between preferred theories and methods and forecast accuracy cannot be established.},

Our results indicate that negative oil price shocks are followed by an uptick in the number of protests and that a higher initial size of the shadow economy allows to mitigate the negative consequences of low oil prices on the likelihood of protest. To explain these results, we show that negative oil price shocks lead to a significant increase in the size of the shadow economy in highly oil dependent countries and that this countercyclical behavior is largely due to oil-price-driven income shocks. In our estimations, a decrease in the GDP per capita by one percentage point increases the shadow economy by 0.54 percentage points. This suggest that the shadow economys capacity to absorb persistent oil price fluctuations without provoking political unrest, should regard it as a mitigation tool rather than an economic burden.},

  abstract = {We scale theoretical/ideological positions of economic research institutes over debates. Using only parts of German research institutes’ business cycle reports that deal with economic policy advice as an example, we extract sections from these reports dealing with monetary and fiscal policy issues from 1999 to 2020. To these corpora, we apply methods of unsupervised text scaling (Slapin and Proksch, 2008; Lauderdale and Herzog, 2016), namely Wordfish and Wordshoal. Roughly, results are in line with common sense in the public policy discourse. For monetary policy texts, we observe a strong, but short-lived consensus in debate-specific positions at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and a larger polarization thereafter compared to the sample period before. For the fiscal policy text corpus, the polarization was similarly high before and after the crisis and decreases somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic. For both policy areas, the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the Institute for World Economics (IfW), Kiel, tend to be the most diverse institutes within the spectrum of latent ideological positions. We argue that text-mining techniques might be useful to scale underlying ideological positions in policy-related publications.},

  abstract       = {This paper proposes a new methodology to study sequential corpora by implementing a two-stage algorithm that learns time-based topics with respect to a scale of document positions and introduces the concept of Topic Scaling, which ranks learned topics within the same document scale. The first stage ranks documents using Wordfish, a Poisson-based document-scaling method, to estimate document positions that serve, in the second stage, as a dependent variable to learn relevant topics via a supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This novelty brings two innovations in text mining as it explains document positions, whose scale is a latent variable, and ranks the inferred topics on the document scale to match their occurrences within the corpus and track their evolution. Tested on the U.S. State Of The Union two-party addresses, this inductive approach reveals that each party dominates one end of the learned scale with interchangeable transitions that follow the parties&rsquo; term of office, while it shows for the corpus of German economic forecasting reports a shift in the narrative style adopted by economic institutions following the 2008 financial crisis. Besides a demonstrated high accuracy in predicting in-sample document positions from topic scores, this method unfolds further hidden topics that differentiate similar documents by increasing the number of learned topics to expand potential nested hierarchical topic structures. Compared to other popular topic models, Topic Scaling learns topics with respect to document similarities without specifying a time frequency to learn topic evolution, thus capturing broader topic patterns than dynamic topic models and yielding more interpretable outputs than a plain Latent Dirichlet Allocation.},
