Etablierte soziologische Forschungsarbeiten zu Wirtschaftsprognosen haben gezeigt, dass soziale Interaktionsprozesse zwischen den Akteur*innen der Prognostik innerhalb eines Netzwerks konstitutiv für die Herstellung von Prognosewissen sind. Dieses Papier aktualisiert und erweitert diese Erkenntnisse für die besonderen Bedingungen während der Corona-Pandemie. Mittels einer sozialen Netzwerkanalyse und der Auswertung von qualitativen Interviews mit führenden Prognostiker*innen im deutschsprachigen Raum wird gezeigt, dass die Bedeutung von sozialen Interaktionsprozessen innerhalb eines erweiterten Netzwerks zwischen Akteur*innen der Wirtschaftsforschung und -politik während der Corona-Pandemie stark zunimmt. Epistemische Interaktionen stellen sicher, dass in dieser weitreichenden gesellschaftlichen Krisensituation überhaupt plausible und glaubhafte Prognosen über die ökonomische Zukunft produziert werden können.},

After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of traditional impulse response functions for nonlinear models, we introduce the concept of a generalized impulse response function which, we argue, is applicable to both linear and nonlinear models. We develop measures of shock persistence and asymmetric effects of shocks derived from the generalized impulse response function. We illustrate the use of these measures for a nonlinear bivariate model of US output and the unemployment rate.}

abstract="The bag-of-words representation commonly used in text analysis can be analyzed very efficiently and retains a great deal of useful information, but it is also troublesome because the same thought can be expressed using many different terms or one term can have very different meanings. Dimension reduction can collapse together terms that have the same semantics, to identify and disambiguate terms with multiple meanings and to provide a lower-dimensional representation of documents that reflects concepts instead of raw terms. In this chapter, we survey two influential forms of dimension reduction. Latent semantic indexing uses spectral decomposition to identify a lower-dimensional representation that maintains semantic properties of the documents. Topic modeling, including probabilistic latent semantic indexing and latent Dirichlet allocation, is a form of dimension reduction that uses a probabilistic model to find the co-occurrence patterns of terms that correspond to semantic topics in a collection of documents. We describe the basic technologies in detail and expose the underlying mechanism. We also discuss recent advances that have made it possible to apply these techniques to very large and evolving text collections and to incorporate network structure or other contextual information.",

In turn, in a noisy information model, augmented with a simple media channel, we document that the time series features of relevant topics help explain time-varying information rigidity among households. As such, we provide a novel estimate of state-dependent information rigidities and present new evidence highlighting the role of the media in understanding inflation expectations and information rigidities.}

The agent builds (as economists do) a simplified model of the world which is sparse, considering only the variables of first-order importance. His stylized model and his resulting choices both derive from constrained optimization. Still, the sparse max remains tractable to compute. Moreover, the induced outcomes reflect basic psychological forces governing limited attention. The sparse max yields a behavioral version of basic chapters of the microeconomics textbook: consumer demand and competitive equilibrium. I obtain a behavioral version of Marshallian and Hicksian demand, Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, the Slutsky matrix, the Edgeworth box, Roy’s identity, and so on. The Slutsky matrix is no longer symmetric: nonsalient prices are associated with anomalously small demand elasticities. Because the consumer exhibits nominal illusion, in the Edgeworth box, the offer curve is a two-dimensional surface rather than a one-dimensional curve. As a result, different aggregate price levels correspond to materially distinct competitive equilibria, in a similar spirit to a Phillips curve. The Arrow-Debreu welfare theorems typically do not hold. This framework provides a way to assess which parts of basic microeconomics are robust, and which are not, to the assumption of perfect maximization. }",

abstract = {To predict choice behavior, the standard practice of economists has been to infer decision processes from data on observed choices. When decision makers act with partial information, economists typically assume that persons form probabilistic expectations for unknown quantities and maximize expected utility. Observed choices may be consistent with many alternative specifications of preferences and expectations, so researchers commonly assume particular sorts of expectations. It would be better to measure expectations in the form called for by modern economic theory; that is, subjective probabilities. Data on expectations can be used to relax or validate assumptions about expectations. Since the early 1990's, economists have increasingly undertaken to elicit from survey respondents probabilistic expectations of significant personal events. This article discusses the history underlying the new literature, describes some of what has been learned thus far, and looks ahead towards making further progress.},

abstract = {This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.}

In particular, the hypothesis asserts that the economy generally does not waste information, and that expectations depend specifically on the structure of the entire system. Methods of analysis, which are appropriate under special conditions, are described in the context of an isolated market with a fixed production lag. The interpretative value of the hypothesis is illustrated by introducing commodity speculation into the system.},

This means that the temporality of capitalism is composite and contradictory, simultaneously still and hyper-eventful.
